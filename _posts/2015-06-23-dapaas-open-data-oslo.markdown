On Thursday July 2nd, the DaPaaS team, [SINTEF][2] and [DIFI][3] will be hosting an event designed to create discussion around the struggles and triumphs of the modern open data movement.

Whether you're a seasoned expert or a newly minted open data buff, the day will cater to everyone. The Open Data workshops and DaPaaS Data Labs will be facilitated by Amanda Smith of the ODI and hope to connect like minded individuals, foster a healthy discussion and introduce some of the linked open data tools the project has been developing. This will be followed by an evening gathering of the community's open data enthusiasts. Built into each event is the opportunity for knowledge sharing by the way of flash talks on anything open data related.

If you'd like to join us, please sign up for the day's [workshop][4] and/or the evening [meetup][5]. You can contact us: [amanda.smith@theodi.org][6] and follow us [@dapaasproject][7]
