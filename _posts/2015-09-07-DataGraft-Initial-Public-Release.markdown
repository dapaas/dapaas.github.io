### The hard graft of Linked Data ETL

As part of our DaPaaS project, [Swirrl][1] is creating a software suite called 'Grafter', an Extract, Transform, Load [ETL] system designed specifically for Linked Data.

Swirrl's work on helping public sector organisations to share their information as Linked Data usually involves converting the data from its source form (which is almost always tabular in nature) to a linked data graph. Doing this repeatably, reliably and efficiently is a challenge. After reviewing the many existing tools that tackle aspects of this problem, Swirrl concluded that none of them were quite the right match for this job, so decided that it was time to develop a new Linked Data ETL tool set.

You can read more about [the design decisions behind Grafter][2] in [Rick Moynihan's][3] article on the Swirrl blog.
