We are glad to announce new features and improvements to [DataGraft](https://datagraft.net/)!

New features:
* Downloadable transformations as stand alone jar files: you can design your data transformations on DataGraft and run them locally on your machine;
* Public preview of transformations: you can now preview public data transformations hosted on DataGraft without the need to be signed in;
* Step preview of transformations: more intereactive support in the design of data transformations - you can now see how you data changes with each step in the transformation;
* Visualization widgets for published data: you can advartize your data by setting up visualization widgets in your data pages.

Improvements: fixed a number of software [issue](https://github.com/dapaas/grafterizer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), performed backend optimisations, and improved [documentation]( https://datagraft.net/documentation/).
