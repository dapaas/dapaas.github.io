"Evidence indicates that poor quality data publishing (both syntactic and schematic) can be a major barrier to reuse of open data."

![null][1]

Hosted by the [ODI][2] and [Swirrl,][3] our open data publishing and discovery workshops convene data publishers and developers to showcase and test tools, share experiences, problem solve and co-design future open data tools an services.

At the heart of these tools is [DataGraft;][4] a platform for data publishing, transforming and hosting, developed by the [DaPaaS project][5].

This half day workshop gives attendees the opportunity to test a range of complementary open data tools and improve their data publishing, from initial spreadsheet or database exports through to the creation of 5-star linked data. Participants will also be able to contribute towards the development of best practises, gain hands-on-experience in data publishing, share their own products and ideas and co-design further tools that meet their user needs.

Our first workshop will be held in Manchester's [Museum of Science and Industry][6] on Tuesday 25th August, 13:00 - 16:00. [Register for your free ticket now.][7] and help us [spread the word on Twitter][8]

The next workshop in this series will be held in London on Wednesday 9th September, 13:00 - 16:00. Please register your interest [amanda@theodi.org][9] to avoid disappointment.
